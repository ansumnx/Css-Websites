            1. HTML (Hypertext Markup Language): <br />
        <br />

        HTML is the foundation of front-end development. It's used to structure
        the content of a web page, defining elements like headings, paragraphs,
        links, images, and forms. Learn about HTML5, the latest version of HTML,
        which introduced new elements and features for building modern web
        applications. <br />
        <br /><br />
        2. CSS (Cascading Style Sheets): <br />
        <br />

        CSS is essential for styling web pages. You'll use it to control the
        layout, colors, typography, and visual aspects of your website. Study
        CSS3, which includes advanced features like flexbox and grid layout for
        creating responsive designs. <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        3. JavaScript: <br />
        <br />

        JavaScript is a programming language used for adding interactivity and
        dynamic behavior to web pages. It's a fundamental skill for front-end
        developers. Learn the core concepts of JavaScript, including variables,
        data types, functions, loops, and conditionals. Then progress to more
        advanced topics like DOM manipulation and asynchronous programming.
        Responsive Web Design: With the proliferation of various devices and
        screen sizes, responsive web design is crucial. Learn how to create web
        layouts that adapt to different screen sizes using techniques like media
        queries and fluid grids. Understand mobile-first design principles,
        which involve designing for mobile devices first and then scaling up for
        larger screens.
